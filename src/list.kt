//Assignment 9: Lists
//1. Given a list of 10 strings, write a function that returns a list of the strings at even indices i.e index 2,4,6 etc (2 points)
//2. Given a list of peopleâ€™s heights in metres. Write a function that returns the average height and the total height (2 points)
//3. Given a list of Person objects, each with the attributes, name, age, height and weight. Sort the list in order of descending age (2 points)
//4. Given a list similar to the one above, write a function in which you will create 2 more people objects and add them to the list at one go.
//5. Write a function that takes in a list of Car objects each with a registration and mileage attribute and returns the average
//mileage of all the vehicles in the list. (3 points)
